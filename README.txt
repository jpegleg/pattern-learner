pattern-learner:
Read the Simple Event Correlator documentation: https://simple-evcorr.github.io/

A sec.pl and bash pattern learner which identifies unique occurrences in text lines for system alerting and auditing.

Edit the learner.cfg and replace PATTERN_YOU_ARE_LOOKING_FOR_GOES_HERE with the pattern you want to alert on.

Whenever that string is matched in /var/log/net.log, a sec.pl (SEC) child process will spawn 
the shell script /usr/local/bin/pattern-sorter which will pull strings that match PATTERN_YOU_ARE_LOOKING_FOR_GOES_HERE
from /var/log/net.log and check to see if that pattern has been found before.  The shell script
also writes a lock file with the patterns contents. Those lock files are a way to control
the alerting in real time if you so desire; remove a lock file to trigger that pattern on the
next match.

Once the pattern is matched, excluding the archive of occurrences and no lock file exists, the data will be written to /var/log/new-deny.log
This is a log which has every unique pattern that has been found. This log is read by another sec.pl 
child process which sends each line as an email to root@localhost. Adjust that email by editing the

/etc/learner-watcher.cfg

The maximum locks ( known patterns ) will be different on each machine. I am working on a standardized lock file management system to add to this, but for now that is up to you.

This is a template that is to be customized to fit the situation. 
See https://github.com/jpegleg/net-gargoyle which is an alerting system
made with this template.
